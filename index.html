    <p>Hello My name is Francis and I am a IT Network Specialist. I enjoy watching basketball, hanging with friedns and spending time with my family. 
    My goal is to be the best specialist the technology world has ever seen and I am confident with my ability of a hardworking ethic,
    I can do so beyond my eyes can see. I think the most interesting part of technology is the music that can be transmitted. 
    The data that is in our apple devices, the creation of the apple company, it is a great thing that apple music is accessible for people.</p>
