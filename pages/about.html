    <h1>This is Our About Page</h1>
    <P>Capacity Bay is a great bootcamp. 
    They have been keeping us informed and focused on how to think outside the box with the technology language we are applying.
    This helps people expand their minds and thinking patterns regarding the new methodologies growing within the Tech world. 
    Programming is nowt an easy task and with the help of class being twice a week it can keep most of us in a focused mindset to be able to achieve the most of programming. 
    One of the good things of this course is being able to practice code for an hour a day.</P>
